**Project Title: ETL Process for Data Extraction, Transformation, and Loading**
****************************************************************************************************************************************************************
**Description:**
This project demonstrates the practical implementation of ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes using Python. 

**It covers:**
  1.Data Extraction: Extracting data from multiple file formats ( XML,json,csv).
  2.Data Transformation: Transforming the data, including unit conversions and cleaning.
  3.Data Loading: Loading the transformed data into a structured CSV format for further analysis or reporting.

Throughout the process, detailed logging is used to monitor the progress, which is critical for debugging and tracking the flow of data at each stage of the ETL process.

This project showcases essential data engineering skills, including handling different file formats, performing unit conversions, and ensuring data integrity during the transformation process.

**Features**
  Data Extraction: Read and parse XML files from a specified directory.

  Data Transformation: Perform necessary data transformations, such as converting units and cleaning data.
  
  Data Loading: Export the transformed data into a CSV file.

  Logging: Log each step of the process for monitoring progress and troubleshooting issues.

  Error Handling: Gracefully handle common issues like permission errors, missing files, and invalid data.
